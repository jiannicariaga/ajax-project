A front-end web application for gamers seeking their next virtual adventure.

## Why I Built This

As a seasoned gamer, I wanted to build an application that empowers users to easily read about any video game. I am often given video game recommendations by friends but needed a place where I could quickly find, save, and review them. GameFinder adresses these needs with live search suggestions, bookmarks, and plenty of video game meta data all in one place.
